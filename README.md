I’ve tried to build a modular approach to the problematic, the code logic has been split between 3 parts: Search, Api, and Visualization.
Each part should be quite easy to swap, for example, you could change the display Grid to instead display charts without any struggle.
I’ve used React, Material-UI, and Typescript.
As I am writing those lines, the http://mock-api.voodoo.io/ is still down and I can’t test my work, I let it plugged to the fake API, but will plug it back if it comes back alive :)
